#Programming Experience

I have been programming since I was a senior in high school. I loved working with the CAD
programs in my "Understanding Technology Class" and decided I wanted to study how computers
actually work. So I started programming. Then I went to UW for two year and studied Java and
really enjoyed it, until I was rejected from the CS program there. So now I am at OSU and 
loving it. I am excited to get into the field of computer science I am in love with it even
though I am sometimes not the best at programming. But really that is why I am here! I want
to learn.
